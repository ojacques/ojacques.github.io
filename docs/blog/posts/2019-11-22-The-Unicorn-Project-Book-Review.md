## A sequel?

"[The Unicorn Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-unicorn-project/)" is out.
Since
"[The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/)",
which - according to IT Revolution - "wowed half-million readers" since 2013, a
lot of readers from the IT industry are eager to discover the new adventures of
"Parts Unlimited", a company being disrupted on its journey to
[better value, sooner, safer and happier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKrhdyjGoM8).

I was privileged to get an early copy of the book and I dove right in. The first
question I wanted to answer is if the book was a sequel to "The Phoenix
Project". And indeed, it is. Same company - Parts Unlimited -, same urge to
change to survive, same challenges and same project - The Phoenix Project - on
which the company is betting its future.

Yet, there is absolutely no need to read The Phoenix Project prior reading The Unicorn
Project. All the characters are introduced gradually, as well as the book's plot.

For this review, I will follow the subtitle of the book as my plan:

"**A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in
the Age of Data**"

(which can be contrasted with the subtitle of The Phoenix project: "A Novel
about IT, DevOps and helping your business win").

## Developers

In The Unicorn Project, we will not follow Bill Palmer - VP of IT operations -
the hero of The Phoenix Project. [Gene Kim](https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim)
introduces a brand new character, **Maxine Chambers** - Developer Lead and
Architect.

Yes, you got it, this time, we are going to dive deeper in the developer's
world. Not that the book is all about developers, debugging, Continuous
Integration or unit tests, but it is very much the focus, at least for the first
good half of the book.

And it makes sense to me. Actually, I find this very interesting that what used
to be details left to developers, like source code management, continuous
integration, test automation, environments on demand with Docker, and automation
of deployments are now frequently front and center in discussions with
executives, up to CIOs and sometimes CEOs. I fully expect that The Unicorn
Project will even reinforce this. As you will see while reading the book,
transforming the "Parts Unlimited" company to adopt a great engineering culture
will directly lead to better business outcomes and organizational performance.

## Digital disruption

Remember Eric, board member from the Phoenix Project? Eric acted as the
[Sensei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensei) (guru), advising Bill Palmer.
Well, Eric is back, now acting as a bartender 🍸 in the bar where the team meets
weekly. That's obviously a cover as Eric is still a member of the board.

While I found this role of a Sensei sometimes weird while reading The Phoenix
Project, I found this time that Eric plays its role fully. And Eric is not
alone. Gene references many other Senseis and acknowledges their work - which
gives us more references to follow. Here is an awesome list of Senseis I could gather:
[Rich Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure), Dr.
[Nicole Forsgren](https://nicolefv.com/), [Jez
Humble](https://twitter.com/jezhumble),
[Risto Siilasmaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risto_Siilasmaa),
[Dr. Steven Spear](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/steven-spear),
[W. Edwards Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming),
[John Allspaw](https://twitter.com/allspaw), [Paul
O'Neill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H._O%27Neill),
[Dr. Geoffrey Moore](https://twitter.com/geoffreyamoore),
[Clay Christiansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen).

## The Five Ideals

While Eric came up with
"[The Three Ways](https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/)"
in the Phoenix Project, he now introduces
"[The Five Ideals](https://itrevolution.com/announcing-the-unicorn-project-and-availability-of-first-excerpt-and-the-five-ideals/)"
(that Gene Kim introduced first at
[a talk at DevOpsDays Portland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOmoHCLDsG4&feature=youtu.be&t=2086)).

The Five Ideals, as detailed by Eric (and Gene) are as follows:

* **The First Ideal**: Locality and Simplicity 
* **The Second Ideal**: Focus, Flow, and Joy 
* **The Third Ideal**: Improvement of Daily Work 
* **The Fourth Ideal**: Psychological Safety 
* **The Fifth Ideal**: Customer Focus

I won't go into details here, as the book is doing an awesome job at providing
explanations, context and ideas as to how to apply them. I will say though that
there is a great chance for those to become, like "the three ways", a great guide
for our industry.

## The age of data

Data in The Unicorn Project Book, like in real life, takes the front row. It's
with data that Parts Unlimited can now customize its marketing campaigns and
optimize revenues and stocks like never before. It's also with data that the teams
operate their applications, make informed decisions on what to focus on and are
able to react quickly when things go wrong.

We can often read that data is largely unused and can unlock immense business
outcomes. The Unicorn Project gives practical examples of using data, and even
the start of a technology stack to get started and grow from there. Impressive.

## Transforming and asking for permission

I had a blast reading the story of the team behind "The Unicorn Project". The
story of "The Rebellion" - as they like to call themselves - reminded me of
earlier DevOps transformation days at HP, which we shared with
[Ralph Loura and Rafael Garcia at DevOps Enterprise Summit 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9nNqqie_sM).

Indeed, it does often take a great dose of courage - and/or really strong
leadership commitment - to often break the rules that have been established for
years. I experienced this in my first DevOps journey, and it looks like a
pattern that I often see elsewhere. 

Another technique I used to trigger the start of transformation are
"[Value Stream Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping)" which
do a great job of showing the current state, and initiate a transformation.

## Workforce optimization and reskilling

The last section of the book is my favorite. So, hang tight and read it through the end! 

It's also a difficult section. When you optimize work, there is a big temptation
to take what you save and turn that into opportunities for workforce reduction.
"The Unicorn Project" gives guidance in that space too. It's a set of chapters
you will want to read multiple times, like I did.

Parts Unlimited ends up investing in their people and creating a continuous
learning organization. I also believe this is the right path, as [Joan Watson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joan-watson-8b01a4117/) and I shared during [an earlier talk at the DevOps Enterprise Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhokY2UpBqI).

## Conclusion

"The Unicorn Project" is a new reference book. With no doubt, Gene Kim and the
Senseis will - again - massively and positively influence any company, any
organization which depends on software, that is: all companies in 2020.

Buy it, offer it to your developer leads, to the executives you want to
influence. You will not regret it, neither will they, nor their customers.

## One more thing

The book has a lot of references: blogs, other books and also videos. So that
you don't have to assemble theme, I created a **playlist** with all the references
from the book. A must watch before, and after reading the book.
