This decision is not purely based on cost, as I wanted to also learn few things on nginx reverse proxying and Docker.</p> <p>I ended up running multiple Wordpress sites on a single VM leveraging Docker. I did not go the \"Wordpress Multisite\" route for the following reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Easier move from existing hosting provider: restoring a single site config on a multisite config is rather complex and would prevent to move to other providers if I wanted to</li> <li>Found out that there is not much overhead when running multiple WPs and even DB on one VM. At least with my level of traffic</li> </ul> <p>To run multiple sites, with different SSL certificates, each Wordpress site runs its own container and is proxied by an Nginx proxy that handles SSL thanks to LetsEncrypt.

The cost of doing that was not visible to me as network cost was embedded in the one.com pricing. But, on Azure, my outbound bandwidth cost went way higher that what I was expecting. It took me some time to figure out that monitoring from outside was causing this. I do not really need outside monitoring, so I turned it off.</p> <p></p> <p>The entire setup is in a private GitHub repo I own. A <code>docker-compose up</code>, and I am off and running.

I wanted to get one of those NVidia RTX 3060 TI (~ 450\u20ac), but there is a big semiconductors shortage, which may last until 2022 according to analysts.  Plus, I will have to probably upgrade the motherboard, CPU, RAM and power supply. Not fun \ud83d\ude23.</p> <p>Time to try something I have been contemplating for a while: get my video rig to the cloud! AWS offers G4 EC2 instances equipped with NVidia or AMD GPUs, and Azure has its NV series, powered by NVidia Tesla M60.</p> <p>I have tried both, and ended up keeping the AWS one. Apparently Azure was short of NV6 with GPUs in my region (France), which prevented to raise account restrictions despite several tickets.</p> <p>To optimize costs, I use AWS spot instances, terminate the VM on shutdown, snapshot the EBS storage with a Lambda function triggered by a cloudwatch event and create an AMI out of it. Starting the VM amounts to double-click on a script which starts it from a launch template.</p> <p></p> <p>To get very fast response time with video and audio, I do not use the standard remote desktop solution, but PARSEC, which is also used for gaming rigs. And that went beyond my expectations: the response time has been great (I do have cable at home though) and very usable for video editing.</p> <p>\ud83e\udd2b I could not resist and installed a few games on it. Project Cars 2 is working great, and I can even plug my Thrusmaster racing wheel thanks to VirtualHere which expose local USB devices to a remote system. So, I now can use the VM for both video AND occasional gaming (I doubt VR...).</p> <p>What about cost? I have been using <code>g4dn.xlarge</code> EC2 spot instances (4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM), with a 300 Gb EBS storage. The 300 Gb EBS costs me $0.39/day ($11.7 / month), snapshoted and used as an AMI. The hourly cost is approximately $1 / hour (which includes the VM, the EBS storage and network bandwidth to stream the screen with PARSEC at 50 Mbps). I don't have cost associated with uploading my videos to the VM to work, but I will get billed when downloading the video back.</p> <p></p> <p>If I use the VM 4 hours per week, that will be ~$25.7 / month or $308 / year. This is still under the 450\u20ac for the RTX 3060 TI (plus, I avoid having to upgrade my motherboard, CPU and RAM too). I also probably can accomodate lower than 50 Mbps with PARSEC, which can easily cut the cost even further.</p> <p>Time will tell on the long run, but for now, I'll stick with this solution and not buy new hardware.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2021-02-28/february-2021/#octocat-i-became-a-github-sponsor","title":":octocat: I became a GitHub sponsor","text":"<p>I use Visual Studio Code a lot (including for this blog post), with one of my favorite extension being the draw.io integration by @hediet_dev.

The intent is to be able to set a specific laser figure at the right time (controlled by the timeline), and then modulate it based on what I play on the keyboard and how I play and leverage aftertouch. In summary, the intent is to control a laser light, as naturally as the instrument. Easier said than done!</p> <p>Given that I use Ableton Live during shows for backing tracks and even controlling the other lights, I wanted to stick with that. The really cool thing about Ableton is that you can create (or reuse) small filters (\u00e0 la Linux) which will fulfill a very simple function. For example take the value of the aftertouch (how I hard I press the key on the keyboard) and use that value as an input for another function.</p> <p>I eventually came up with this setup:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>DMX is a protocol which is mainly used to control lights. I have a small DMXIS interface (from USB to DMX with great electrical isolation) I have been using for years to control other lights. My laser has that interface too to control some parameters of the laser (not as flexible as ILDA interface, but good enough for what I want to achieve)</li> <li>OSC is another protocol which aims at replacing the antique MIDI protocol (which I used back in the 90's on my Atari ST!)</li> </ul> <p>Then, chaining several plugins in Ableton (live grabber for OSC and Expression control +) makes it possible to achieve my goals.</p> <p></p> <p>I don't think it has ever been done, so I'm quite excited to see how far this can go and wow the audience!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2021-03-31/march-2021/#taking-over-a-php-app","title":"Taking over a PHP app","text":"<p>Every year, I volunteer at \"La Coupe Icare\", a beautiful 3 days event for free flight.

Here are 6 ways that I have used or witnessed, with my experience on each one.</p> <p>The idea of setting time aside to improve, and reduce technical debt is not new. At the beginning of projects we often sort budget for documentation, tests, refactoring. But after a first sprint or two this budget gets used on new features and we end up with technical debt piling up. We all know this is bad, but how can we set time aside to improve? Like, continuously improve?\u00a0This blog will look at ways I have used to set budget (time) aside to improve.</p> <p>Note: the \ud83c\udf99 Tech Debt Burndown podcast is a great resource if you want to learn more on tech debt and how to address it.</p> <p>Let us just use the following hypothesis:</p> <ul> <li>You want to set aside 25% of your team capacity on improving</li> <li>You have an Agile Scrum team with a 2-week sprint cadence</li> </ul> <p>Here are the 6 ways I will describe below, in one diagram:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2020-05-06/6-strategies-to-set-time-aside-to-improve/#1-25-improving-on-top-of-everything-else","title":"1. 25% improving, on top of everything else","text":"<p>When asking an IT leader or manager if they support reducing technical debt and improving how work gets done, the answer will often be yes, with the caveat that this can be done without impacting the delivery of new features.</p> <p>The risk with this strategy is that you will never find time to improve. Under certain conditions, the team can go an extra mile to improve how they do work. But this cannot last long. Worse, if this becomes an expectation, productivity will be impacted as morale will suffer.

This can take the form of addressing a major security breach, swarming during a production outage or even halting the business because the SAN for which you did not upgrade the firmware decided to shutdown.</p> <p>You can be lucky and recover.

The improvement team","text":"<p>You don't find time to improve: the team is overloaded. What about getting a team, approximately 25% of the size of the current team, dedicated to improving? This may work, if the goal is to use that team for a period of time. This way, you may be able to reduce technical debt enough to recover some capacity and get back to the habit of continuously improving.</p> <p>I will argue that this should only be temporary. Improvement needs to be part of every team's charter. It is more effective and also more rewarding for people. Now, getting help from enabling teams, as described in the Teams Topologies book, is a good idea when you need to acquire skills and coaching to do so.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2020-05-06/6-strategies-to-set-time-aside-to-improve/#4-rolling-improvement-role","title":"4.

The advantages of being a complete sprint are numerous: this is uninterrupted improving work, with no context switching. Also, a full sprint is a significant amount of work to be able to come up with improvements which are visible. The team will be able to celebrate and look forward for the next round!</p> <p>One technique I used was to describe the content of the improvement sprint in the form of an imaginary press release, as we were kicking it off.
